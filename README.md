# RedBrick AI React Developer Coding Problem

In this exercize you will take a very simple, but very buggy feature and make it work well and look good.

This is primarily an exercise in:

1. Debugging
2. Following best practices and standards
3. Demonstrating knowledge of how react state updates work
4. Styling with plain CSS

## Installing and running this project

```bash
$ npm install
```

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Launches the CRA at http://localhost:3000

## Desired end result:

A **PRIVATE** github repository shared with derek@redbrickai.com that contains a useful history of commits as you complete the task.

The functionality should be a single button that shows and hides content. Each time showing the content should generate a new random number.

There is also a timer that counts up, showing the time in seconds since the page loads.

## How to complete this:

1. Make it work
2. Make the code pretty (simple code is pretty code)
3. Make the component look nice with styling

### 1. Make it work

There are a handful of weird, buggy, or just incorrect behaviors in the way the given code is implemented.

It would likely be FASTER for you to just start from scratch, but we want you to demonstrate that you understand WHY these patterns are bad and how to correct them.

So, please do your best to show the evolution of your project through git commits and messages.

Examples of incorrect behavior you might encounter on your way to fixing some bugs:

- Random number is updating continuously
- Nothing happens when clicking the button

### 2. Make the code pretty

After making it work, and fixing the bugs with the current design (and showing this in the git history) feel free to restructure the code to achieve the same result with a simpler structure.

### 3. Make the feature look pretty (style it)

Try to replicate the result given below. We are looking for precision.
